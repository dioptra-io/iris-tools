This repository contains a collection of tools for managing Iris.
For example, it includes utilities for publishing Iris data, checking
container logs, and updating Iris agents without the need to recreate
them.

Note that some of these tools, which interact directly with the
Iris containers running on the Iris server, must be executed on the
Iris server itself.
